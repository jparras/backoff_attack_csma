# Wireless Networks under a Backoff Attack: A Game Theoretical Perspective

## Introduction

Code used to obtain the results in the paper Parras, J., & Zazo, S. (2018). Wireless Networks under a Backoff Attack: A Game Theoretical Perspective. Sensors 2018, 18(2), 404. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/s18020404).

Note that a second publication expanded this work to Repeated Games: Parras, J., & Zazo, S.  (2019). Repeated game analysis of a CSMA/CA network under a backoff attack. Sensors 19(24), 5393. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/s19245393)  [Code](https://github.com/jparras/rga_csma)
